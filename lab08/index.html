        <p>
            Since coming to Syracuse, I have been a <strong>Success Scholar </strong> and on the Deanâ€™s List, two accomplishments I am very proud of. While attending Syracuse I have also created a club called Orange Connect which requires strength in leadership. I also am the Director of Family events for my sorority which would not be capable without strong organizational skills.With several different types of experience at SU, I hope to pursue a career in management consulting post-graduation.

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>
            Outside of school and organizations, I love to read books in my free time, preferably romance or historical fiction. I find reading a book with a cup of tea is the best way to wind down before bed!
