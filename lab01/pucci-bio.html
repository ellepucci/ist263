        My name is Elle Pucci. I am currently a sophomore at Syracuse University double majoring in Policy Studies and Information Management & Technology. Since coming to Syracuse, I have been a Success Scholar and on the Deanâ€™s List, two accomplishments I am very proud of. While attending Syracuse I have also created a club called Orange Connect which requires strength in leadership. I also am the Director of Family events for my sorority which would not be capable without strong organizational skills. With several different types of experience at SU, I hope to pursue a career in management consulting post-graduation. Outside of school and organizations, I love to read books in my free time, preferably romance or historical fiction. I find reading a book with a cup of tea is the best way to wind down before bed!
